## Overview

An opportunity arose for me to finally read a new book written by [Ben Frain](https://benfrain.com) called "[Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://amzn.to/2X1xz9t)".

I was looking forward to this book because I love HTML and CSS. Responsive web design is something I've been really passionate about since getting into web development and something I've been trying to inspire others to include in their projects as a primary objective, especially with mobile-first development.

## Review

For me, the opening could not have been written better. It's engaging, helpful and cleverly written that it doesn't give too much of the rest of the book away. It attracts any developer from any background to learn about the importance of responsive design.

I can agree when it says the book is for full-stack developers, backend developers looking to "gen up on their front-end skills" and front-end developers looking for a "definitive overview of everything that modern HTML and CSS has to offer". As a front-end developer, this is exactly what I am looking for; I know responsive design, I know HTML5 and I know CSS.

What hit the nail on the head for me, very early on, the author talks about the importance of mobile-first design and how scaling up is a more effective way to design and develop. This is a topic I am very passionate about and always try and notify new front-end developers about very early on into their learning.

I felt there were times the book strayed from the focus of _responsive design_ as it went into a lot of detail about HTML and CSS - probably too much for the book - with some areas touching on responsive design. As a mid-level front-end developer, the best way for me to get the most out of this book was to skim the sections that were telling me about HTML and CSS.

Some sections, especially the more technical sections were quite difficult to follow. I believe this is nothing wrong with the book itself, but the fact it is a _book_. A book doesn't allow for any interactions or live previews and everything is printed on a page.

With all this in mind, I honestly believe this book is worthwhile for anyone who is new to web development and front-end. As a beginner, you will come away with a vast knowledge of HTML5 and CSS and what they have to offer, and some ideas on how you can begin creating effective responsive websites.

What's also good is the book offers code files for you to download, so it's really nice to be able to code while following on with the book. ðŸ‘Œ
