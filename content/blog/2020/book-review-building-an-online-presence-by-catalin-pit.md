"[Improve Your Online Presence](https://gumroad.com/a/875132019)" by [Catalin Pit](https://twitter.com/catalinmpit).

I was excited to read this book because I've been looking at how I could improve my online presence. I feel I have a pretty good presence currently, but there's always room for improvement, right?

I was fortunate for Catalin to allow me to read this book pre-release.

I'm not one who strives for 100k Twitter followers or 1M tweet impressions - don't get me wrong, they would be nice, but it's not my objective. I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jackdomleo7) to create connections, build a community and share my opinions.

Having a **good** online presence can help bring you:
- New friends
- Opportunities, such as talks and podcasts
- Satisfaction when something you've done has helped someone else
- Recognition
- And so much more

Catalin's book was incredibly useful in helping me maintain my presence and I have also adopted many tips to improve certain aspects of my presence.

It's jam-packed with useful tips that _could_ help anyone on Twitter and LinkedIn!

What does it for me, is Catalin's tone throughout the book: It's written in a way where he is describing what worked for him and it's got that warm feeling to keep you motivated!

I hope [this book](https://gumroad.com/a/875132019) helps you find new friends and lots of opportunities!! ðŸ”¥
