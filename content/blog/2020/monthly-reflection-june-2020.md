## What did I do? üíª

### New articles üì∞

### Additions and modifications to <nuxt-link to="/">my website</nuxt-link>

In <time datetime="2020-05">May 2020</time>, my website would get anywhere between 10 and 50 visitors a day. In <time datetime="2020-06">June 2020</time>, the average number of site visitors could be anywhere between 200 and 300 a day. I was motivated to work on my website to make it more engaging for visitors.

Here are the improvements and additions:

- Implemented [Nuxt Feed](https://github.com/nuxt-community/feed-module) so I can have an RSS feed for my blog
- Show my latest article on my homepage
- Improved the design of my <nuxt-link to="/projects">projects</nuxt-link> page
- Added "What I'm currently doing" section to home page
- Added "Top projects" to home page
- Added "My toolbox of skills" to homepage
- Added a contact form to home page using [Formspree](https://formspree.io)
- Created a <nuxt-link to="/portfolio">portfolio</nuxt-link> page
- Added a Buy Me a Coffee button
- Redefined my theme colours to make them more accessible (I aimed for WCAG AAA, but some combinations are WCAG AA)
- Search field on blog page

### Miscellaneous

- Purchased CodePen PRO
- Redesigned a new open graphic for my blog posts (these can be found by appending <a href="og.png">/og.png</a> to the end of any blog post URL)
- Joined [DEV.to](https://dev.to/jackdomleo7)
- New Twitter and LinkedIn banner

### I was approached by [Ravit Jain](https://twitter.com/RavitJain) at [Packt Publishers](https://www.packtpub.com) to read and review a book

This was an exciting opportunity. At the time of writing, I am still currently reading this book.
I was given a FREE copy of [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition) by [Ben Frain](https://benfrain.com) to read and write a review when I am finished. I was also asked to hold a giveaway event on Twitter to help gain traction to the book from the Tech Twitter community. The giveaway was a success and a lot of fun!

## Achievements üéâ

### [Jhey](https://twitter.com/jh3yy) liked one of my GSAP animations

I've currently been learning [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) and have honestly found it difficult. So, I'm happy with the comments Jhey had to say about my airplane animation - they were really encouraging. Soon, I'm going to start the [Creative Coding Club](https://www.creativecodingclub.com/bundles/creative-coding-club) course by [Carl Schoof](https://twitter.com/snorklTV).
