## What did I do? 💻

### Released my first ever eBook!!! Level-Up Your Career Today: Developer Edition

I released my first ever eBook, '[Level-Up Your Career Today: Developer Edition](https://levelupyourcareer.today)' on <time datetime="2020-10-31">31<sup>st</sup> October 2020</time> and I was so happy with the responses.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚀 Today is LAUNCH DAY!!<br><br>&quot;Level-Up Your Career Today: Developer Edition&quot; is now available to buy, download and read! 🥳<br><br>Months of hard work and research went into this book and I hope you all enjoy it!<br><br>Only $10!<a href="https://t.co/GRqNW65fhP">https://t.co/GRqNW65fhP</a></p>&mdash; Jack Domleo (@jackdomleo7) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1322522463272579073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2020</a></blockquote>

### Launched [Checka11y.css](https://github.com/jackdomleo7/Checka11y.css)

Checka11y.css is an open-source project of mine and its intention is to be a developer tool that consists of a CSS stylesheet that will highlight some accessibility errors and warnings. Not all accessibility errors and warnings will be highlighted by Checka11y, and that's ok, because there are other tools developer could use Checka11y along with such as a text editor plugin and Chrome's Lighthouse feature. Not every accessibility developer tool is perfect, so it's a good idea to use a multitude of options.

It was amazing to see so many developers want to contribute to Checka11y, especially during Hacktoberfest. I feel contributors and issue raisers will be _forced_ to research about the issue they are raising or resolving, therefore learning a little bit more about accessibility and get a better understanding.

### Spoke about HTML & CSS at [GeeksForGeeks SRMIST's](https://twitter.com/SRM_Univ) Web Blow webinar

### Discovered [www.producthunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com)

I recently discovered this website and really liked the idea behind it so I created some posts for some of my existing products and plan to use it more in the future:

### Moved all my notes from [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com) to [Notion](https://www.notion.so)

I'm not a pen and paper note-taking kinda guy, I like my notes to be cloud-based and easily accessed on any of my devices. I also love the fact I can type out notes because my handwriting is terrible.

Evernote wasn't not great, it's a good application. But I decided to give Notion a shot because of the big hype around it and it is my new favourite thing! Easily navigable, so perfomant fast, easy to use, looks neat! 🔥
