## What did I do? 💻

### Resumed writing my first eBook

I'm currently still working on my new eBook, [Level-Up Your Career Today](https://levelupyourcareer.today), trying to make it a really quality book with the help from some really outstanding pre-readers!

### Created an open-source accessibility tool - [Checka11y.css](https://github.com/jackdomleo7/Checka11y.css)

I wanted to create a CSS-only tool that would flag up accessibility concerns straight away as you're developing, and that's exactly what Checka11y.css does.

I also wanted a project where contributing is easy and beginner-friendly and encourages contributors to research and learn more about web accessibility.

So far, Checka11y has been a huge success!

### Guest appeared on Whiskey Wednesday

I guest appeared on [Whiskey Wednesday](https://twitter.com/WskyWednesday) show about accessibility and it was a fantastic experience!

### Speaker at Mintbean's Quiz App Showdown Hackathon talking about accessibility

**Accessibility at the Forefront of our Minds**

I was offered the opportunity to be a speaker a Mintbean's Hackathon, which I couldn't refuse! Despite some technical difficulties at the start, it was a huge success and I didn't let my stammer get in the way! 💪

[See here for the GitHub repo linked to this talk.](https://github.com/jackdomleo7/TALK-accessibility-at-the-forefront-of-our-minds)

_I will post the YouTube video here when Mintbean publish it_

### Back at work full-time 💼

After nearly 4 months being on furlough due to Coronavirus, I was brought back to work full-time on September 1<sup>st</sup> 2020.

### Health 💪

Started going to the gym to help strengthen my heart, increase stamina, clear my mind and generally get fitter. Decided to get a gym membership, not bad for £20 a month.
