During summer <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, I began writing an eBook. It was an exciting experience, but I hit some challenges along the way, and I learned a lot during the research, writing, promoting and selling of the eBook that I'd like to share with you. If you're thinking of writing your own eBook someday, then I hope this article and my experience will help you during the process of writing your book.

## Why did I write an ebook?

During summer <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, I was made furloughed on the UK Job Retention Scheme during the Coronavirus pandemic - basically, I had about 4 months of free time with no work, but I was still being paid a salary. I utilised this time focusing on my development skills by learning new tools, languages, and programming and design concepts. I could feel myself approaching a burnout because I was doing something developer-related almost all day, every day. It's fair to say I was getting a little bored of coding at that time and I just needed something else to do. Since I've always wanted to write an eBook at some point in my career, I felt now (summer <time datetime="2020">2020</time>) would be a perfect time to start, and would be a nice break from constant coding.

At such a young age, I've felt for a long time that I've achieved so much in so little time and have made some really good choices with my career that I feel were the best choices for me. I have no degree (only my school education), never completed my apprenticeship due to redundancy and have faced the 'age' issue for quite a while. Don't worry, I wasn't made redundant for any other reason than the company I was employed at as an apprentice went bankrupt. From what I've gained in such little time and the knowledge I do know about levelling up careers, I decided to base the topic of my ebook on this - this ebook has become very popular primarily amongst new/junior developers. I found a gap in the market for a developer book with the theme of focusing on your career and how you can improve it from a wider view by making small improvements to many small areas of your career.

But this article is not about me, my education or my career - the focus of this article is the process during the writing, promoting and selling of the ebook. However, if you are interested in my journey into development, consider reading my article, <nuxt-link to="/blog/how-i-went-from-a-retail-assistant-at-17-to-landing-a-developer-role-at-19">How I went from a Retail Assistant at 17 to Landing a Developer Role at 19</nuxt-link>.

Becoming a published author can be a lengthy process and often a lot of work - you have to find a company to publish you, you have to write the book, you have to refine the book, they have to review the book, then you have to wait for them to print the book and do the promoting on your behalf. Then ultimately, you could end up only half owning the book you wrote. This wasn't going to work for me - I wanted to self-publish, completely own my book and do the promoting myself.

I decided to do an ebook for many reasons over a printed book. Firstly, printed books cost a lot of money for the raw materials and the printing process, which is the kind of money I don't have, whereas the cost for making a single ebook costs nothing (if you exclude writing hours). This ties in really well with being green and looking after the environment by not using a lot of paper and ink. Ebooks are ever-growing extremely popular since a lot of people love reading books on their mobile phones and/or tablet devices from anywhere, whereas with a book you might forget to take it with you. With websites such as [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/jackdomleo7), it's really easy to write and self-publish an ebook, giving you the freedom to manage the earnings, promotions and everything else. I like seeing Gumroad as a great application for content creators looking to create and sell their own content. The last real benefit from only making an ebook is the fact that you can update and iterate over the book, so the first release is never the finished product.

## Writer's Block

Writer's block is a condition in which a writer temporarily loses the ability to produce new work or experiences a creative slowdown. This loss of ability to write and produce new work is not a result of commitment problems or the lack of writing skills.

I experienced writer's block many times while writing the eBook. I knew what I wanted to write about, I just didn't know exactly what to say. When you have a really good idea, then forget it and you're frustrated that you forgot it, writer's block is like that.
