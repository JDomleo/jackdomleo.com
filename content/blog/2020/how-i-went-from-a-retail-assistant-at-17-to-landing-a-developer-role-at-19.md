## Overview

In this article, I will share my experience going from a student through to a respected developer at 19 years old. I will share my tips and advice, what I had to sacrifice, what my regrets were and what my commitments were. By the end of this article, I hope you will feel inspired to share your path.

**I want to first get this out of the way, my age does not matter! This article is targeted for anyone of any age! Anyone can make the journey to a developer at any point in their life.**

Lately, I've been asked a lot what my path was and how I got to where I am today, so I was inspired to write this article. At the time of writing, please be aware, I am not currently in my dream role, but I am on a very good path to getting there and you can be on your dream path too.

## My Dreams and Goals

I really love front-end development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, art, calling APIs, accessibility, UI & UX - all of it interests me and I want to learn more. My current position is a Developer, but I want to strive to be a Front-end Developer at a company who really appreciates my abilities OR I would really love to freelance, I haven't quite decided yet.

I want to strive to be the **best front-end developer I can be for myself**, but I will never reach that goal. Why? This goal for me is always just out of reach, I will always trend towards it but will never get there; this is what motivates me to learn more, to do more and to help and inspire others. The fact I never reach it doesn't mean I'm failing, it means I'm always reaching higher, I haven't capped my succes, **don't cap your success** ([quote from Danny Thompson](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev/status/1271974653880348678)). It's not an unrealistic goal, it's an inspirational goal which any of us can have.

This not to say I will neglect backend development, it's just not an interest of mine right now... It might be in the future.

You will strive and excel in an area where your heart is at! Don't force yourself into anything you don't enjoy, it won't get you far and don't let anyone else force you into that either.

## My Journey

My journey is simple: I began as a student in secondary who found part-time jobs while studying, decided not to go to University, found an appremticeship, landed a Junior Developer role, then promotion to a Developer role. But I have written my journey in detail, in case you were interested.

For a good resource, plese check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-domleo).

I am not saying this is <em>the</em> journey. This is <em>a</em> journey. This was and still is <em>my</em> journey.

### Student and Before Full-time Work

Before we dive into my education and part-time jobs, let's establish some definitions and what they mean to me living in England.

- **GCSE**: General Certificate of Secondary Education (level 2 qualification)
- **A-Level**: GCE (General Certification of Education) Advanced Level
- **Sixth Form**: 2 years of post-GCSE academic education where students usually study their A-Levels

In England, it's the law to be in education until the age of 18, usually this means three paths for a student after their secondary education: sixth form, college or a lower apprenticeship. Each of these will offer some sort of level 3 qualification or multiple level 3 qualifications. Each of these paths are usualy post secondary school and pre university. But not all of us choose the university path...

#### School

As a child, I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I had ideas and I had suggestions - Pilot, Ground Crew, Scientist, IT Technician - but I had no definitive career goal until half way through my final year of sixth form. Notice I didn't even consider software developer, strange right?

I studied Python as my first programming language and I found it difficult, I found it challenging and I found it frustrating. I told myself, "You'll never be a developer, you can't even write a simple script". Early on, I had already told myself I was a failure. I kept pushing through Python and Computer Science theory but was not picking it up easily. In my final year of sixth form, I don't know what it was, but something clicked for me, something made sense to me and I was hooked onto doing more Python and learning more about coding! I submitted my A-Level Computer Science programming project as "Cashier System" - [view GitHub repo](https://github.com/JDomleo/A-Level_Cashier_System).

I would like to give my kudos and special thanks to my teachers who supported me throughout school and sixth form, provided me with the education needed and guided me to where I am today - [Mr Chris West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-west-5b22a762) and [Mr Paul Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-stevens-b6154745).

#### GCSE

I began my secondary school education at [The Redhill Academy](https://www.theredhillacademy.org.uk) in <time datetime="2011">2011</time> but began my GCSE education in <time datetime="2013">2013</time>. I studied English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Business Studies, German and Computer Science.

### IT/Developer Apprentice

I signed up to an apprenticeship provider called [3aaa](www.3aaa.co.uk), their job was to find a company willing to employ me under and apprenticeship scheme. This means, 3aaa are in charge of my theory training and my employer pay for the training and I also go to their place of work to do work. There was an 80/20 split between work and apprenticeship coursework, which worked out nicely.

I was employed by [flybmi](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flybmi) in <time datetime="2019-09">September 2018</time> as an **IT/Developer Apprentice**. My role was essentially training to be a developer with some IT Technician training too. I was on a level 3 apprenticeship - but I should have ideally been on a level 4 - that last was supposed to last 13 months.

I was at flybmi for 6 months before they collapsed in <time datetime="2019-02">February 2019</time> but those 6 months was one of the biggest learning curves for my career. I had my first real introduction to web development starting with HTML5 and CSS3 (and Bootstrap)
