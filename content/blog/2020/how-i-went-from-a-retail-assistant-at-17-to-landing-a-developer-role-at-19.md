## Overview

In this article, I will share my experience going from a student through to a respected developer at 19 years old. I will share my tips and advice, what I had to sacrifice, what my regrets were and what my commitments were. By the end of this article, I hope you will feel inspired to share your journey.

**I want to first get this out of the way, my age does not matter! This article is targeted for anyone of any age! Anyone can make the journey to a developer at any point in their life.**

Lately, I've been asked a lot what my path was and how I got to where I am today, so I was inspired to write this article. At the time of writing, please be aware, I am not currently in my dream role, but I am on a very good path to getting there and you can be on your dream path too.

## My Dreams and Goals

I really love front-end development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, art, calling APIs, accessibility, UI & UX - all of it interests me and I want to learn more. My current position is a Developer, but I want to strive to be a Front-end Developer at a company who really appreciates my abilities OR I would really love to freelance, I haven't quite decided yet.

I want to strive to be the **best front-end developer I can be for myself**, but I will never reach that goal. Why? This goal for me is always just out of reach, I will always trend towards it but will never get there; this is what motivates me to learn more, to do more and to help and inspire others. The fact I never reach it doesn't mean I'm failing, it means I'm always reaching higher, I haven't capped my succes, **don't cap your success** ([quote from Danny Thompson](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev/status/1271974653880348678)). It's not an unrealistic goal, it's an inspirational goal which any of us can have.

This not to say I will neglect backend development, it's just not an interest of mine right now... It might be in the future.

You will strive and excel in an area where your heart is at! Don't force yourself into anything you don't enjoy, it won't get you far and don't let anyone else force you into that either.

## My Journey

My journey is simple: I began as a student in secondary who found part-time jobs while studying, decided not to go to University, found an appremticeship, landed a Junior Developer role, then promotion to a Developer role. But I have written my journey in detail, in case you were interested.

For a good resource, plese check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-domleo).

I am not saying this is <em>the</em> journey. This is <em>a</em> journey. This was and still is <em>my</em> journey.

### Student and Before Full-time Work

Before we dive into my education and part-time jobs, let's establish some definitions and what they mean to me living in England.

- **GCSE**: General Certificate of Secondary Education (level 2 qualification)
- **A-Level**: GCE (General Certification of Education) Advanced Level
- **Sixth Form**: 2 years of post-GCSE academic education where students usually study their A-Levels

In England, it's the law to be in education until the age of 18, usually this means three paths for a student after their secondary education: sixth form, college or a lower apprenticeship. Each of these will offer some sort of level 3 qualification or multiple level 3 qualifications. Each of these paths are usualy post secondary school and pre university. But not all of us choose the university path...

#### School

As a child, I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I had ideas and I had suggestions - Pilot, Ground Crew, Scientist, IT Technician - but I had no definitive career goal until half way through my final year of sixth form. Notice I didn't even consider software developer, strange right?

I studied Python as my first programming language and I found it difficult, I found it challenging and I found it frustrating. I told myself, "You'll never be a developer, you can't even write a simple script". Early on, I had already told myself I was a failure. I kept pushing through Python and Computer Science theory but was not picking it up easily. In my final year of sixth form, I don't know what it was, but something clicked for me, something made sense to me and I was hooked onto doing more Python and learning more about coding! I submitted my A-Level Computer Science programming project as "Cashier System" - [view GitHub repo](https://github.com/JDomleo/A-Level_Cashier_System).

I would like to give my kudos and special thanks to my teachers who supported me throughout school and sixth form, provided me with the education needed and guided me to where I am today - [Mr Chris West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-west-5b22a762) and [Mr Paul Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-stevens-b6154745).

#### GCSE

I began my secondary school education at [The Redhill Academy](https://www.theredhillacademy.org.uk) in <time datetime="2011">2011</time> but began my GCSE education in <time datetime="2013">2013</time>. I studied English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Business Studies, German and Computer Science. I found subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and German relatively easy, primarily because I enjoyed them, a lot. The other subjects I really really struggled with, I had to put a lot of time and effort into those subjects.

During GCSE, I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up, so I had no real passion for any subject, but I knew it would be something related Mathematics, Physics or Computer Science. I went to school, wrote some Python and came home, but I never resumed any programming at home, it just wasn't of any interest to me.

#### Office Assistant

After finishing my GCSEs, still with no real idea for a career, I found a simple part-time job working as an Office Assistant for a small accounting company in Nottingham. My role included shredding files, filing, cleaning and making tea and coffee. I was paid a whopping ¬£3.72 per hour.

I stayed at this job for two months before beginning my A-Level education.

#### A-Level

I began my A-Level education at [The Redhill Academy Sixth Form](https://www.theredhillacademy.org.uk/sixth-form) in <time datetime="2016">2016</time>. I studied Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Chemistry (I only did an AS-Level in Chemistry - half an A-Level). So, I had a better idea of what I wanted to do, I've now narrowed down my 10+ broad GCSE subjects into 4 A-Level subjects all relating to each other in one way or another. I really enjoyed these subjects, they overlapped, covered interesting topics and motivated me to begin looking for career options. But, let's not ignore the fact, I really really struggled with my A-Levels, I found them extremely difficult and challenging because they cram so much content and advanced knowledge into two years. In my opinion, sixth form isn't education, it's preparation for university - I regret going to sixth form and wish I went to a college, but the past is in the past.

My sixth form was challenging in a number of ways: I struggled with the subject content and learning it; they forced university onto us all as if it was the only path and we were worthless if we didn't attend; I was getting older into my late teens and had no income.

My path after sixth form was not that of the norm, I ignored being told I have to go to university to be successful because I am a firm believer that is not true! University has nothing to do with your success, only you can influence your success: if you have passion, dedication and don't cap your success, you will absolutely be successful!

If we did not choose the university path, we skewed the sixth form's statistics - when they sell the sixth form to new potential students, they often state, "_x_% of students go on to university and achieve great things" - _x_ was often a number greater than 85 - but they never ever told the success stories of those who did not choose the university path. I can conclude, their student's were not their top priority, statistics were... However, I do thank those teachers who saw our side and arranged 'non-university' events, such as apprenticeship conventions, practise interviews and CV/resume workshops. üôè

It was in my final year of A-Level did I realise I wanted to pursure a career in software development. We were assigned a Python coursework project to create anything, we were told to find a client and create a specification for a program they may need. You can see my A-Level coursework project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/JDomleo/A-Level_Cashier_System) - please note, this project has been left 'as is' from the time I submitted it.

#### Retail Assistant

As mentioned previously, I was getting into my late teens with no income so, I decided to apply for part-time jobs preferrably working in retail. I applied for a dozen jobs to be faced with rejection or no responses. It's hard for someone with little to no experience finding a job these days. My girlfriend was also applying for jobs and I was proud of her when she was accepted into [Primark](https://www.primark.com) - I applied to Primark previously but failed their online test... _Can you keep a secret? I asked her to redo the online test on my behalf._ Sure enough, I found myself working 8-12 hours a week at Primark.

Despite the reputation Primark has (messy, rude, cheap), it was honestly a really fun job and I loved it. _"The customer is always right?" Completely false! "No ma'am, I can confirm those shoes are indeed not on sale, therefore I will only sell them to you at the price they say on the tag."_ I was called foolish for balancing a part-time job and my A-Levels, but I didn't care, I always looked forward to my Primark shifts, they were a nice break from everything else.

I was at Primark for exactly one year before I began looking for an apprenticeship in software development. Applying for my role in software development was the hardest role I've ever applied for, I was also getting to used to working at Primark...

### IT/Developer Apprentice

This was a difficult role to apply for: not many software apprenticeships out there; didn't recieve any replies; I had no previous experience in software whatsoever. I tried a new tactic, I signed up to an apprenticeship training provider, it's their job to find me interviews. An apprenticeship training provider will provide you the training you need to complete your apprenticeship, however it is not free, hence they need to find you an employer to work full-time for so they will pay for your training through what's called an [Apprenticeship Levy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds). The idea is you spend 20% of your time doing apprenticeship work and 80% of your time doing work for your employer.

Every apprenticeship is different: there are different levels of apprenticeships, different completion periods and different training providers. I recieved my first interview for an airline at East Midlands Airport called [flybmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flybmi) for an IT/Developer Apprentice role. I turned up 45 minutes early on a really hot day in a suit and tie, dripping in sweat and nervously shaking - my interviewers were wearing shorts and a t-shirt... I felt stupid and uncomfortable.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I go for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/developer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#developer</a> interviews, I dress for the job I have applied for.<br><br>These can be non-customer-facing roles. I wear what I usually wear, smart casual:<br><br>- Polo shirt<br>- Casual jacket<br>- Jeans/Chinos<br>- Clean trainers<br><br>I don&#39;t wear a suit &amp; tie. It&#39;s not me.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a></p>&mdash; Jack Domleo (@jackdomleo7) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1272464988515569665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

Before I was able to drive home from the interview, I recieved a phone call congratulating me on getting the job! They loved my enthusiasm towards software and IT. I was enrolled onto a 13 month apprenticeship program at a level 3 (I should have ideally been on a level 4). I learned so much on my apprenticeship and was drawn into front-end and web development, special thanks to [Tim Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijamo) and [George Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-smith-8210428b) for putting up with me and taking the time to train me!

I **never completed** my apprenticeship.

The airline collapsed after six months of my employment (I promise I had nothing directly to do with it). I was worried I would have to restart my apprenticeship at a new company, redo the last six months and delay the completion. My training provider worked hard to find companies who were willing to take on an apprentice half way through their apprentcieship, but it was difficult for them, not many options out there. My former flybmi employees suggested I leave the apprenticeship and go for a junior role instead because they believed I had the skills and passion necessary for a junior role.

### Junior Developer

I was secretly applying for Junior Developer roles in the East Midlands area, while allowing my apprenticeship provider to find apprenticeship interviews on my behalf. I applied for many roles before I recieved an interview opportunity for [Mitrefinch](https://www.mitrefinch.co.uk). I attended the interview wearing clean trainers, black jeans and a polo shirt (no suit and tie). I told them the truth about my experience, my knowledge and skills, but I didn't undersell myself, nor did I oversell myself either.

I was offered the role and I immediately accepted. This was fantastic step forward in the right direction for me. The hardest part about accepting the job was calling my apprenticeship provider to tell them, "Thank you for all your help, but I've landed myself a Junior Developer role".

I was given the task of researching into CSS frameworks and beginning to start transferring the designer's style guide into clean, reusable CSS (or SCSS because that's the CSS preprocessor we chose). This was really encouraging because they put all their trust in me and they weren't constantly watching over my shoulder, but they were there if I needed help, exactly how you should treat a Junior Developer and any other Developer.

I was proud to be a Junior Developer.

### Developer

Three months after landing my Junior Developer role, I had a meeting about my title, they felt like I shouldn't have the 'Junior' in my title, so we discussed it and I recieved what you could call, a 'mini payriseless promotion'. I accepted it, I am now a Developer.

Don't get me wrong, I still don't know a lot about development, but that was ok, because **not knowing something as a developer does not make you any less of a developer!**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;It&#39;s ok to not know something, it doesn&#39;t make you any less of a developer.&quot;<br><br>I was eventually told this, but it was too late.</p>&mdash; Jack Domleo (@jackdomleo7) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1272960956918833154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

I am always learning to this day, as are all of my colleauges and every developer across the world. This is a forever changing industry, as long as you keep up with the basics, you are doing alright! Keep it up! Remember, this is your journey, not anyone else's.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A good <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/developer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#developer</a> always goes back to relearn the basics!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coding</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeNewbie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CodeNewbie</a></p>&mdash; Jack Domleo (@jackdomleo7) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackdomleo7/status/1273234734391443457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

At the time of writing this article, I am still employed as a Developer at Mitrefinch.

## What's Next for Me?

To carry on.

I'm going to keep learning, keep pushing. Make sure I take breaks and plan trips/holidays/vacations that I can look forward to. I want to move out of my family home, get a house with my girlfriend. Developing is not the only thing on my mind.

I am going to keep being enthusastic and passionate about front-end development and hopefully land myself a well paying job, but I won't stop there. _Why?_ **Don't cap your success!**

I really enjoy Twitter, CodePen, LinkedIn, DEV and GitHub and I am determined to keep up my activity on them, posting useful, inspiring tweets and creating some cool pens on CodePen. I am determined to become a better writer and write a lot more articles.

But my biggest goal in the online developer community is to help other become inspired. I want to prove that university is not the only way, there are multiple paths to becoming a developer and we would all love you to **share your story!**

You can see my life had its perks and its downfalls, but I didn't let that stop me on the path I wanted to pursue. This isn't mentioned above, but the **biggest setback** I had in my life was losing my Mum at the age of 14, but I know she would be very proud of me.

## My Advice to Developers of Any Ability

It's always beneficial to anyone to hear advice from someone else, so I've bullet pointed a few tips of mine with resources:

- Find your passion, mine is front-end development but yours could be backend or game development
- Sign up to LinkedIn & Twitter and start following developer related _stuff_
  - There is an amazing Twitter community out there who will all support you in your development
- Don't cap your success, keep reaching
- Absolutely plan other life events, your development career is not the only thing in your life
- Read books, read articles, watch videos, **build a project**
- Take the time to like and comment other developer's work, they would do the same to you - "The best developers give more than they take"
