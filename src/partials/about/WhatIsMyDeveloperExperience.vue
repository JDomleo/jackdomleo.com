    <p>I started my career as a developer in <time datetime="2018-09">September 2018</time> at <a class="link--paragraph" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flybmi" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">flybmi</a> as an IT Developer Apprentice.

    <p>When flybmi filed for administration in <time datetime="2019-02">February 2019</time>, I started a new role as a Junior Developer at <a class="link--paragraph" href="https://www.mitrefinch.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer">Mitrefinch</a> in <time datetime="2019-03">March 2019</time> and was promoted to a Developer in <time datetime="2019-05">May 2019</time>.</p>
    <p>My current role is a Developer at <a class="link--paragraph" href="https://www.mitrefinch.co.uk/" target="_blank" ref="norefferer">Mitrefinch</a>, where I am working on cool, modern software with interesting programming languages, methodologies and frameworks. I am offered many benefits such as <a class="link--paragraph" href="https://www.perkbox.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Perkbox</a>, flexible working, fresh fruit, health vouchers and one afternoon every fortnight for <abbr aria-label="Career Professional Development" data-balloon-pos="down">CPD</abbr>, where I can work on my personal development.</p>
