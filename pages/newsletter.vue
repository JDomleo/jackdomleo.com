    <p>Sign up to my monthly newsletter below!</p>
    <p>Each month I'll be sending a newsletter with some of my latest projects, some of my tips, what I've learned, what resources I've found and what books or courses I have encountered first-hand.</p>
    <p>I'll be sure to keep the content fresh, useful and mine. You can expect great things each month and if you don't like it, you can always unsubscribe and I would really appreciate any feedback.</p>
    <p>You can expect an email in the first week of each month that reflects on the previous month. üëç</p>
